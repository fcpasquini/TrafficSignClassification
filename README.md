# TrafficSignClassification
This project was made as part of the tasks of the "Machine Learning Practical Workout | 8 Real-World Projects" course on the Udemy website, that can be accessed through the link: "https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-machine-learning-practical/".

This project aims to create a Convolutional Neural Network, capable of obtain a good accuracy in the task of classification of German Traffic Signs.

The data of the project was published by the 'Institut Fur Neuroinformatik', in the link: https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html.

The model was created in the jupyter notebook, contained in the file 'Notebooks/main.ipynb'.

The models folder was created to save the different versions of the Neural Network version.
